Quick DynDNS provides free and premium Dynamic DNS services for your members, allowing them to know their current IP address wherever they are.

== Description ==
TimeConverterJS (tcjs) makes it easy to setup your very own Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service, allowing users all of the benefits of knowing their IP address. This can be very handy for users hosting web services at home who do not have the benefit of owning a static IP address.

= Easy Setup =
Out of the box, Quick DynDNS can be turned on with a mouse click, and can be added anywhere on your website using the [tcjs] shortcode or the included widget without a hassle. The Dashboard Widget will give you concise statistics about how tcjs has been used, and tracks historical usage over time.

= Configurable =

= Dashboard widget =
The Dashboard Widget is designed to give you concise statistics about how tcjs has been used, and tracks historical usage over time.

= Widgets =
The widget that comes with Quick DynDNS can be placed anywhere on your site that will accept a widget, and shows the exact same information as the [tcjs] shortcode. The widget is provided as a convenience; if you want to place the tcjs information somewhere unusual on your website, the [tcjs] shortcode will be easier to use.
